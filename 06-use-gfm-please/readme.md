## An GFM Editor wrote for my article

### Usage

Open this in Chrome please. Demo here:

### Goal

It's also a Markdown LiveEditor.  
Previously I decide to write my words, but I come across a question:  

> "If Markdown is great, why dont't you write this in Markdown?"  

Well, sounds a good idea to use GFM for this article.  

Hope people like it.
